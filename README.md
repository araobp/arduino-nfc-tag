Let's make an interactive digital photo frame with dynamic NFC tag!

## Motivation

My PC has been broken, and it will take a few weeks to get my PC repaired.

I use this time to make an interactive digital photo frame based on RasPi and Arduino.

## Parts

- RasPi
- Arduino UNO
- ST25DV04K dynamic NFC tag
- Capacitor sensor
- LEDs
